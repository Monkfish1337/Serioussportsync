# 📅 SeriousSportSync — Sports Metadata & Calendar Add-on

> A self-hosted add-on that turns combat sports, pro-wrestling, motorsport and more into proper meta items — with a built-in calendar of upcoming events and optional resolve-on-play of cached links via your own indexers and debrid accounts.
>
> 🎯 **Primarily designed for [Nuvio](https://github.com/zaarrak/Nuvio)** (a Stremio-compatible client tuned for sports/live content). Also works with **Stremio** and other compatible clients.

## ✨ What it does

SeriousSportSync is, first and foremost, a **sports metadata add-on and event calendar** for Nuvio / Stremio:

- 📅 **Calendar of upcoming events** for every supported sport — see what's airing this week or next month, with posters, dates, and event descriptions, all browsable in Discover.
- 🏷️ **Proper meta items** for sports events that mainstream meta providers (IMDb / TMDb) don't index — so they actually appear as first-class entries instead of being unfindable.
- 🔎 **Smart per-event search aliases** built into each promotion so name-matching indexers find the right scene release for the right event (number, date, fighter / driver / wrestler matchup).
- 🎯 **Optional resolve-on-play streaming** — if you've configured your own indexers and debrid accounts, the add-on advertises stream rows without touching any debrid; the resolve happens only when you press play. A search can never pollute your debrid account, and a single provider outage can't stall results from the others.
- 🛡️ **Provider-side filter awareness** — automatic keyword pre-filter and a self-learning denylist for hashes that fail provider-side content checks, so dead rows are pruned over time.

```

**Bring your own sources, bring your own accounts.** Point it at any combination of Prowlarr, Zilean, and/or a drop-in HTML-indexer module. Plug in keys for any supported debrid provider on a per-user basis. The metadata + calendar work with zero indexers configured; the optional streaming side needs at least one source **and** at least one provider key.

---

## 🚀 Quick start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/serioussportsync.git
cd serioussportsync
cp .env.example .env
# Minimum: set SESSION_SECRET (openssl rand -hex 32) and ADMIN_USER.
docker compose up -d --build
```

The container listens on `:7000`. First-run setup:

1. 🔑 Open `http://<your-server>:7000/` — you'll get a **login / first-run signup** page. Create an account; if its username matches `ADMIN_USER`, it's auto-promoted to admin.
2. 🛠️ *(Optional, for streaming)* Go to **Admin → Indexer sources** and enter your indexer URL(s) + key(s). You can also set these via env; the GUI overrides env and applies live without a restart.
3. 🧩 *(Optional)* Drop a custom HTML-scraping module at `lib/sources/extra.js` (or `lib/sources/local.js`) exporting `multiSearch(queries, opts)` — loaded automatically alongside the built-in sources. Gitignored, never committed.
4. 🔐 *(Optional, for streaming)* On your **account page**, paste your debrid provider key(s). Each user manages their own.
5. ✅ Copy your personal **install URL** from the account page and add it in **Nuvio** (or Stremio): **Add-ons → paste the URL → Install**.

Even with zero indexers and zero debrid keys configured, the calendar and metadata catalogs work fully — you'll just see meta rows without stream options.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Everything is env-driven with sensible defaults (see [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full annotated list). Indexer endpoints can also be set in the admin GUI, which overrides env.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | _(required, ≥32 chars)_ | Signs login cookies — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. The server refuses to boot if unset or too short. Dev escape hatch: `ALLOW_INSECURE_SECRET=1`. |
| `ADMIN_USER` | — | Username auto-promoted to admin on first signup |
| `LOGIN_MAX_FAILS` / `LOGIN_WINDOW_MS` / `LOGIN_LOCKOUT_MS` | `5` / `900000` / `900000` | Per-IP login rate-limit: lock out after N failed sign-ins within window-ms, for lockout-ms |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | _(auto)_ | Public origin for install URLs (honours `X-Forwarded-*`) |
| `ADDON_TYPE` | `movie` | Client item type (`tv`/`series` for some clients) |
| `PROWLARR_URL` / `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | — | Prowlarr indexer source (or set in GUI) |
| `ZILEAN_URL` | — | Zilean DMM-hashlist source (or set in GUI) |
| `TSDB_API_KEY` | `3` | TheSportsDB key (`3` = free; Patreon key = higher limits) |
| `EVENT_WINDOW_DAYS_BACK` / `_AHEAD` | `30` / `90` | Calendar / metadata sliding window |
| `REFRESH_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `6` | Metadata refresh cadence (0 = off) |
| `STREAM_CACHE_TTL_HOURS` | `6` | Candidate-cache freshness |
| `STREAM_CACHE_REFRESH` / `_HOURS` | `on` / `3` | Proactive candidate warmer |
| `RD_BLOCKED_KEYWORDS` | `AMZN,NF,CR,YTS,RARBG,WEBRip` | Skip rows whose title contains a tag a provider is known to keyword-filter — see [Provider keyword filtering](#-provider-keyword-filtering) |
| `RD_DENYLIST_TTL_DAYS` | `30` | How long a 451-flagged hash (hard) stays out of advertised rows |
| `RD_SOFT_DENYLIST_HOURS` | `24` | How long a non-451 "not cached / unresolvable" RD hash stays out of advertised rows (may come back if it later gets cached) |
| `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` | — | Route public indexer traffic via a VPN (keep internal services in `NO_PROXY`) |

🔐 Debrid provider keys are **never** env vars — they're per-user, entered on each user's own account page. Admins can rotate tokens but cannot see install URLs or provider keys.

## 🛡️ Provider keyword filtering

Some debrid providers have started returning content-unavailable errors for cached files whose filename contains certain release-tag keywords. It's filename-keyword filtering at the provider's end (not per-hash takedown) and affects every add-on in the ecosystem that fronts those providers.

SeriousSportSync defends in **two layers**, without sending probe requests during a search:

1. 🚦 **Pre-filter at row-build** — `RD_BLOCKED_KEYWORDS` (a comma list, env-tunable, no restart needed) skips affected provider rows for any candidate whose title matches. Free, no provider calls. The default list omits common sports-rip tags (e.g. `WEB-DL`) so legitimate releases aren't pruned upfront; the denylist below backstops anything that does slip through.
2. 🧠 **Persistent denylist** — when a provider blocks a hash at resolve time, the hash is recorded to `data/rd-denylist.json` (30-day TTL by default). Future stream rows skip that provider for that hash for everyone on the instance. Self-healing.

Other providers that don't apply the same filter continue to show rows for the same candidates.

**Resolve-on-play flow:** `/stream` advertises one row per supported provider per top candidate. Each row's URL points at `/u/<userId>/<token>/resolve/<provider>/<eventId>/<infoHash>`. The client's "play" click hits that endpoint; the addon then calls that provider's resolve path and 302-redirects to the playable URL. A provider is touched only on a real play — never on a search.

**Background timing at a glance:**

- ⏱️ Metadata refresh: **every 6 h** (`REFRESH_INTERVAL_HOURS`)
- 📦 Candidate-cache TTL: **6 h** (empty entries **30 min**)
- 🔥 Candidate warmer: **every 3 h**, window –90 days to +1 day
- 🚫 Provider-filter denylist TTL: **30 days**

## 🧩 Adding a promotion

Append an entry to `all` in `lib/promotions.js`. Each promotion is fully self-contained:

```js
{
  id: 'bellator',
  name: 'Bellator MMA',
  idPrefix: 'bellator',
  enabled: true,
  source: { type: 'thesportsdb', leagueId: 'XXXX' },
  posterShape: 'landscape',
  classify(name)    { /* → kind */ },
  buildAliases(name){ /* search aliases */ },
  isRelevantStreamTitle(title, event) { /* gate candidates */ },
  catalogs: [
    { id: 'bellator-recent',   name: 'Bellator Recent',   filter, sort },
    { id: 'bellator-upcoming', name: 'Bellator Upcoming', filter, sort },
  ],
  includeEvent(ev)  { return true; },
  genres(ev)        { return ['Sports', 'MMA', 'Bellator']; },
}
```

`manifest.js`, `catalog.js`, `streams.js`, and the refresh scripts all consume the registry — no other file needs editing. Restart and the new catalogs appear in the client's Discover.

## 🔧 Manual operations

```bash
# Force a metadata refresh now
docker compose exec serioussportsync npm run refresh

# Warm the stream-candidate cache now (or use Admin → "Warm stream cache now")
docker compose exec serioussportsync npm run refresh-streams

# Health probe
curl http://localhost:7000/health

# Debug a stream resolve (shows rejection reasons) — needs a user's token
curl "http://localhost:7000/u/<userId>/<token>/stream/movie/ufc:NNNNN.json?debug=1" | jq

# Inspect the provider-filter denylist
cat data/rd-denylist.json
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- 🕓 **Catalog / calendar empty after install** — the first refresh runs in the background on boot if the cache is empty (~1–3 min). Watch `docker compose logs -f serioussportsync`.
- 🚫 **No streams** — confirm a source is set (Admin → Indexer sources) and a provider key is on your account. Use the `?debug=1` endpoint to see rejection counts.
- 🔄 **Version not updating in the client** — clients cache the manifest; remove and re-add the add-on to pick up a new version.
- ⏱️ **TheSportsDB 429s** — the refresh paces calls and retries; a Patreon key raises the limit.
- 🔴 **Lots of dead provider rows** — see [Provider keyword filtering](#-provider-keyword-filtering); the keyword pre-filter and persistent denylist together should cull them within a few search cycles. If your set of dead rows shares a tag that isn't already blocked, add it to `RD_BLOCKED_KEYWORDS`.
- 🐛 **Stale candidate cache** — `data/stream-cache.json` is the persistent indexer-result cache; deleting it forces a full re-search on the next request. The proactive warmer will rebuild it in the background.
